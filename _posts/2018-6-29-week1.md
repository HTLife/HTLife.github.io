- Meeting Date: 29.06.2018
- Attendee: Chanoh, Won, Mike, Danial

### Paper reviewed
- Paper Title: Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory  

- Reason: some of the recent deep SLAMs are utilizing differentiable neural computer(DNC). This is the original paper on DNC.

- Useful materials: ​https://greydanus.github.io/2017/02/27/differentiable-memory-and-the-brain/​

- Code(pytorch and tensorflow) and videos are available.
