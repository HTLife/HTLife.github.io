Paper Title: Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory  
Reason: some of the recent deep SLAMs are utilizing differentiable neural computer(DNC). This is the original paper on DNC.
Explanation: ​https://greydanus.github.io/2017/02/27/differentiable-memory-and-the-brain/​
Code and videos are available.

It's application in SLAM.
